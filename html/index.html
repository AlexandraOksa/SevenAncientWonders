<h4>Great Pyramid of Giza</h4>

<br>

<p>
    The Great Pyramid of Giza was built in 2570 BC 
    and the only ancient wonder still standing. It took 
    20 years and 100,000 people to complte the Great 
    Pyramid. The pyramid was built as a tomb for 4th 
    dynasty Egyptian pharaoh Khufu/Cheops. It was built 
    as part of a bigger sturture that incuded tempels 
    and many other pyramids.
</p>

<p>
    The outer layer of the pyramid was made out of 
    polished white limestone. But the outer layer with 
    limestones were broken by an earthquake more than 
    600 years ago. The stones were later removed to 
    build cities and mosques. When the pyramid had the 
    polished white layer of limestones, some people 
    believed it was so large and bright that it could 
    be seen from the moon.
</p>

<p>
    There are many speculations about the pyramid, 
    both intentions, the moon, references to the Orin 
    contstellation, gravity and space. However, the 
    speculations that are true is: the 4 sides of the 
    base is more thatn 700 feet long, and differ in 
    lenght by no more than 8 inches. The 4 sides of the 
    pyramid is almost aligned with the 4 cardinal 
    points of the compass, north, south, east and west. 
    Also that the pyramid´s dimensions convert a ratio 
    that equates to 2pi with nearly perfect accurcy.

<h4>Hanging Gardens of Babylon</h4>

<p>
    he Hanging gardens of Babylon was built in 600 
    BC and it was destroyed by an earthquake in 226 BC. 
    The most interesting fact about the gardens is that 
    there is no actually prof or evidence about whether 
    the Hanging gardens existed at all.
</p>

<p>
    About the Gardens was real or not is still not 
    concluded. But there are may elaborate accounts and 
    poetic descriptions of the gardens. They are 
    believed to have been built by King Nebuchadrezzar II, 
    for his wife that missed her gardens from home. 
    It was either bulit on the rooftop or in the walls 
    of the royal palace.
</p>

<p>
    Bavylon was in the middle of thee desert and had 
    no such natural greenery. However, recent excavations 
    hav shown the use of a sysmtem of irrigation using a 
    cellar will in conjuction with a chain pump to raise 
    the waters to the garden. Other theories means that 
    the gardens were not i Babylon at all. Rather, 
    the Hanging gardens of Babylon were built by Sennacherib 
    at the eastern bank of the Tigris river.
